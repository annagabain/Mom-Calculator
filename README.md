Site owner's goal:

The site’s goal is to provide a easy-to-use tool to simplify budgeting tasks.

Potential features to include:

- A score tracking system - balance green yellow red

- Images to support the correct/incorrect answers 
- User can create a username
- Feedback - "You tend to overspend/save/manage just right this month"
- Charting functionality to represent the data easily digestible manner - with google graphs
- Supporting facts surrounding the data and any insights gleaned from the data - suggestions to optimise costs (e.g, you can buy baby clothes from the local second hand; cook more, take-out less)
